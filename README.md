# Divide-Conquer-Multiply.

In this project, our goal is to implement a BigInteger class and integrate it into a console program to support arithmetic operations involving large numbers. Specifically, we will focus on implementing the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, which efficiently multiplies large integers. The aim is to enhance the capabilities of our calculator by enabling it to handle arithmetic operations on numbers that exceed the limits of conventional data types.

### Implementation of BigInteger and Console Program using Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm

In this project, our primary objective is to create a powerful numerical tool that can handle arithmetic operations involving extremely large numbers â€“ far beyond the capacities of standard data types. To achieve this, we will introduce a custom BigInteger class and integrate it seamlessly into a console program. Moreover, we will employ the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm to optimize the multiplication of these large integers.

**BigInteger Class:**
Our custom BigInteger class will serve as the foundation for managing large numbers. It will allow us to perform addition and subtraction operations on integers of virtually any size. This class will be equipped with methods to initialize, manipulate, and output these BigIntegers. Furthermore, it will play a pivotal role in realizing the efficient Karatsuba multiplication.

**Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm:**
The Karatsuba algorithm is a powerful technique for multiplying large integers more efficiently than traditional methods. It leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy to split the numbers into smaller parts and then combines the results to obtain the final product. By recursively applying this algorithm, we can reduce the number of multiplications required, resulting in a significant reduction in computational complexity.

**Console Program Integration:**
We will extend our existing console calculator to seamlessly incorporate the BigInteger class and the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm. Users will have the freedom to input large numbers and choose arithmetic operations. The program will intelligently apply the Karatsuba algorithm when multiplication is invoked, ensuring rapid and accurate results for extensive numerical computations.

## Project Overview:
1. Implement the BigInteger class to handle large integer values, supporting addition and subtraction operations.
2. Integrate the BigInteger class into the existing console program to enable arithmetic calculations involving large numbers.
3. Develop the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, which will be utilized for multiplying large integers more efficiently.
4. Enhance user interaction by allowing input of large numbers and various arithmetic operations through the console interface.
5. Implement robust error handling to ensure the program's stability even with extremely large inputs.
6. Thoroughly test the program with a variety of scenarios to verify accuracy and efficiency.
7. Document the code, algorithms, and program functionality to ensure clarity and maintainability.

By the end of this project, our console program will be equipped with the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers using the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm. This newfound capability will provide users with a versatile tool for tackling complex numerical computations that were previously hindered by the limitations of conventional data types.
